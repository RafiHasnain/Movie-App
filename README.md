# Getting Started with Movie App

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and `express`.

## Client

Move to the client directory with `cd client`.
In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

## Server

Move to the client directory with `cd server`.
In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Create a `.env` file. Write `PORT` and `MONGODB_URL` just like `.env.example` file.
Make sure `PORT = 5000` because client is expecting `http://localhost:5000`
